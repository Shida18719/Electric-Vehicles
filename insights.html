                    <p>Interest and sales of EVs has accelerated since 2008, when the Tesla Roadster, was first

                        continue to rise. </p>

                        new
                        cars
                        sold will be electric.</p>
                    <p>EVs have seen a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on
                        renewable
                        energy
                        and the potential reduction of transportation's impact on climate change, air pollution, and

                </div>
                <p>So, why EV? Answer to this question is, automobile is one of the leading cause of emissions.
                    <p>As the effort towards tackling climate crisis rises, reducing carbon emissions, the need to
                        meet
                        strict emissions standards globally, pressure from regulators and generous government
                        subsides,
                        have all come together to force the traditional industry to take manufacturing electric
                        vehicles
                        seriously. </p>
                    <p>In addition, fast declining price of batteries will allow auto makers to sell fully electric
                        vehicles for less than vehicles powered by gasoline and disel.</p>

                    <h4>Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p> Also known as All-Electric Vehicles (AEV). This type has no
                        combustion engine, only an on-board battery which
                        provides energy to an electric motor. They are charged from an external electricity supply,
                        typically plugging in to an EV charge point. When required, energy is drawn from the electric
                        cells
                        and converted to motive power by the use of one or more electric motors. </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEVs)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p> PHEVs have a battery, electric drive motor and a small- to
                        medium-sized internal combustion engine (ICE). Which enables operation in full electric mode,
                        using
                        conventional fuel, or a combination of both, and can be recharged from an external power source.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEVs)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p> This is a Zero-Emission Vehicles. They employ <bold>fuel cell
                            technology</bold> to generate the electricity required to run the vehicle. The chemical
                        energy
                        of the fuel
                        is converted directly into electric energy. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEVs)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>This are known as Series Hybrid or Parallel Hybrid. HEVs have both engine
                        and electric motor. The engine gets energy from fuel, and the motor gets electricity from
                        batteries.
                        The transmission is rotated simultaneously by both engine and electric motor. This then drives
                        the
                        wheels. </p>
