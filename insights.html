                    <p>Interest and sales of EVs has accelerated since 2008, when the Tesla Roadster, was first
                        delivered to
                        customers. The auto industry is going through massive change, as the global electric vehicle

                        continue to rise. </p>

                        cars
                        sold will be electric.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>EVs have seen a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on renewable

                        and the potential reduction of transportation's impact on climate change, air pollution, and

                <h3>Why EV</h3>
                <p>So, why EV? Answer to this question is, automobile is one of the leading cause of emissions.
                    <p>As the effort towards tackling climate crisis rises, reducing carbon emissions, the need to meet
                        strict emissions standards globally, pressure from regulators and generous government subsides,
                        have all come together to force the traditional industry to take manufacturing electric vehicles
                        seriously. </p>
                    <p>In addition, fast declining price of batteries will allow auto makers to sell fully electric
                        vehicles for less than vehicles powered by gasoline and disel.</p>

                        <li>Battery storage </li>
