This site will be targeted to drivers, anyone considering driving a vehicle, companies looking to become climate positive, such as changing fleets to environmentally friendly. 

Evinnovation is aim at providing EV news, insights, updates and EV industry in effort to promot zero emmisions

Electric Vehicle is an inevitable innovation that will eventually be adapted by the masses. With many people trying to be climate positive and various government initiatives trying to encourage individuals and businesses to play their part in order to meet the net zero target. 

Various Government agencies and research bodies have confined that electric vehicles are more climate positive than petrol and diesel vehicles. However, there seems to be barriers to the adoption of electric vehicle such as not enough charge points, range issues and convenience. 

This website looks at some of those barriers and innovations in the work to address these. Statistics are showing increase sales in electric vehicle and car manufactures are continuously working to make this an attractive proposition. 
This website aims to educate and demystify some of the myths surrounding early adoption. At very least the website aim to make electric vehicle a viable option and something to consider now or the near future.

# Testing

## Troubleshooting & peer code review

Testing was ongoing throughout the build of this website. I used Google Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along and also asked other on the slack channel to have a look and give me their opinion.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The insights page images and overlay text were not very responsive on smaller screen size. I have used pixels and padding on the overlay text. My mentor advice I should think about the units I was using for sizing and measurement to make the site responsive. Examples, is using percentages for fuidity on containers that I would like to scale, compare to using pixels. And the use of so much padding. That has now been fixed with the use of percentages, padding and margin.   

* The charger and the dynamic image always clinging to either the left or right side when resized for responsiveness. This was resolved after taking off margin-left and margin-right used when styling.

Some of the suggestion raised on slack channel:

* MiaRasmussen_5P, advice that I change the font size used across different screen sizes to improve readability.
* I had issues with some text content running in vertical height when resizes for smaller screen. This was resolved with padding set to zero.

## Code validation
