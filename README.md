## Initial Discussion 

This site will be targeted to drivers, anyone considering driving a vehicle, companies looking to become climate positive, such as changing fleets to environmentally friendly. 

Evinnovation is aim at providing EV news, insights, updates and EV industry in effort to promot zero emmisions

Electric Vehicle is an inevitable innovation that will eventually be adapted by the masses. With many people trying to be climate positive and various government initiatives trying to encourage individuals and businesses to play their part in order to meet the net zero target. 

Various Government agencies and research bodies have confined that electric vehicles are more climate positive than petrol and diesel vehicles. However, there seems to be barriers to the adoption of electric vehicle such as not enough charge points, range issues and convenience. 

This website looks at some of those barriers and innovations in the work to address these. Statistics are showing increase sales in electric vehicle and car manufactures are continuously working to make this an attractive proposition. 
This website aims to educate and demystify some of the myths surrounding early adoption. At very least the website aim to make electric vehicle a viable option and something to consider now or the near future.

# Testing

## Troubleshooting & peer code review

Testing was ongoing throughout the build of this website. I used Google Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along and also asked other on the slack channel to have a look and give me their opinion.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The insights page images and overlay text were not very responsive on smaller screen size. I have used pixels and padding on the overlay text. My mentor advice I should think about the units I was using for sizing and measurement to make the site responsive. Examples, is using percentages for fuidity on containers that I would like to scale, compare to using pixels. And the use of so much padding. That has now been fixed with the use of percentages, padding and margin.   

* The charger and the dynamic image always clinging to either the left or right side when resized for responsiveness. This was resolved after taking off margin-left and margin-right used when styling.

Some of the suggestion raised on slack channel:

* MiaRasmussen_5P, advice that I change the font size used across different screen sizes to improve readability.
* I had issues with some text content running in vertical height when resizes for smaller screen. This was resolved with padding set to zero.

## Code validation

The [W3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator were used to validate this project.

* HTML 
  + [HTML Validator For Home Page](./READMEimages/homepage-html-validation.png)

   + [HTML Validator For Insights Page](./READMEimages/insightspage-html-validator.png)

   + [HTML Validator For Sign Up Page](./READMEimages/signup-page-html-validator.png)

* CSS

  + [CSS Validator For style.css file](./READMEimages/css-style-validator.png)

## Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse on Google Chrome Developer Tools to test for the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

* Home page lighthouse testing - mobile ~ desktop

![Home page desktop lighthouse testing](./READMEimages/homepage-desktop-lighthouse-testing.png)

* Insights Page lighthouse testing - mobile ~ desktop

![Insights page mobile lighthouse testing](./READMEimages/insightspage-mobile-lighthousetest.png)

Suggestions:

  * Serve images in next-gen formats. Lighthouse suggests using image formats of WebP & AVIF to improve compression and lead to faster downloads and less data consumption. I have converted the insights page background image to webp format using Birme. Also re-sized the image to improve load time.

## Test case

  ## Testing Users Stories

+ As a visiting user, I want to be able to navigate easily across the website to find more information.
A user can navigate all three pages from home page header, it is at the top of  all the pages. Also a contact us link to the sign up page and the interactive check list at the bottom part of home page links to the insights page.

![Users Navigation](./READMEimages/user-navigation.png)

+ As a visiting user, I want to learn more about electric vehicle and how it can help me become climate positive. 

![About Electric Vehicle](./READMEimages/user-stories-whatis-ev.png)

![Learn more about Electric Vehicle](./READMEimages/insights-page-display.png)

+ As a visiting user, I will like to join the mailing list for new update.
   * I want to be kept informed on new developments via the website.
     The sign up page provides a form that users can fill in their names and email address, then click on the sbscribe button to join the mailing list.

![Join Mailing List](./READMEimages/user-stories-join-mailinglist.png)

## Fixed bugs
 * Heading and navigation bar not properly aligned on small screen size. Which was hidding part of the sign up button away. This doesn't make for a good user experience as the sign up boutton is one of the Call To Action of the website. This was resolve by taking out the margin left that was inherited from the media query above it.

 * Some issue with image not displaying on the browser, but would display in the editor. After several attempt of fixing the file path, I raised the issue on slack, I was advice by Suzzy_Bee to drag the images folder into the asset folder, it worked firstime. However, same issue occured again. Chris_Williams 5P helped look into it and suggested, the image size was too large. This was fixed by compressing the image using Tinypng.

 * Text overlay not responsive, the overlay box will slide rather than resize to fit. This was fixed using percentages to position the overlay.

## Known Bugs

* The insights page jumps or swirlve some times when  it's pushed. Few suggestions pointed at removing unused codes. But this hasn't really worked.

![Movable Fixed Hdeader bug](./READMEimages/movable-fixed-header.png)
* I discovered there is an openning and closing HTML from the chart that shows up within mine when testing and debbuging on Google chrome dev tool.

 ![Known bug](./READMEimages/known-bug.png)

* A scroll bar on the side of the chart after removing the "no scroll" attribute from HTML as this was displaying error after the HTML validator test. I raised this on slack, and I was advised to use the "overflow hidden" attribute instead, but this hasn't yet being resolved.

* Issue with not able to display backgroung=d image on image Apple products. I raised this on slack, the suggest I got from Jo_ci was that "It seems some Apple devices don't handle the shorthand" correctly. I used the background-image syntax in the media query. Image displayed on ipad, but not on smaller screen size.

## Full Testing

I performed differnt testing on my website using differnt browsers (google chrome, safari, mozilla firefox and MicroSoft Edge) and the devices, such as (iPhone 12, motorola and Apple ipad).

I also went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.

  * Test the link on every page. Each worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.

  * The sign up form work correctly. As I tried submitting the form with just one input after the other, leaving the the other input empty, with the push of the subscribe button.  I was prompted to fill out the remaining field.
